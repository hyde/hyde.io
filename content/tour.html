# Frameworks, languages and patterns. <br/> All comes down to this.
### Hyde is a static website generator. It takes your content, layout and style and flips out a working website. Development is simple: reload the browser and see the changes. Template inheritance let's you stay organized in the wilderness of web development.

- ## Jinja2
    **Jinja2** is one of the cleanest, most beautiful and well thought template language ever made. It is like **Django** but more powerful and 10-20 faster.
    Hyde loves it. Mostly because it supports template inheritance.

- ## Template Inheritance
  CSS separates the style from HTML. Template inheritance does the same for content and layout. It's the most important thing to do to simplify your work. Your site gets naturally organized and development is faster. Once you are spoiled with it there is no turning back to archaic import tags.

- ## Focus on content
  This text you are reading now is written in **Markdown** syntax. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/hyde/hyde.io/blob/master/content/tour.html). Easy to read, easy to modify. Be it you, your designer or any content editor. Enable syntax highlighting and spell checking from your favorite editor and bring back the joy on writing.

- ## Pure Layout
  When content is separated from layout you can make centralized changes to the layout without going trough all the content pages. And you can apply different layouts for the same content. Perhaps an alternate version for mobile clients? Most importantly the layout is clean and you can focus on the task at hand.

- ## Markup freedom
  While it's good to have the content separated from layout Hyde does not force you to do so. You can mix and match HTML and **Markdown** on both content and layout. If you are a fan of **Textile**, **Asciitext** or **reStructuredText** they are all supported. Hyde just provides the tools and best practices.

- ## YAML for data
  HTML meta tags, site configuration, product- and pricing details. Hyde eats data in **YAML** format. It's like **JSON** but simpler. Write it manually or generate from database. The data can be set on site-, folder-, and page level making Hyde extremely powerful.

- ## Website object model
  Upon generation Hyde constructs and object model from your site and you can loop trough the files, folders and data to generate output. Use powerful sorters and grouping tools to to generate all kinds of lists, sitemaps and navigations. Hyde is not just for simple blogs but for large scale websites too.

# Generation freedom
### You can run your favorite tool trough the files. No matter how slow or complext the tool is the result is a lightning fast static page. Any tool goes such as **node.js**, **Ruby**, **Perl** or a **Python** script.

- ## CSS processors
    Hyde let's you write **Less CSS** and **Stylus** directly. Both extend CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions allowing you to write CSS that is more modular. @import rules are applied on the server resulting to fewer page requests. Really changes the way you write CSS. Both are **node.js** scripts.

- ## Compression
  Compression makes your files smaller and faster. Hyde can squeeze all your assets: HTML, JavaScript, CSS and images using tools such as **Uglify JS, Closure Compiler, optipng, stylus** and **HTML compressor**. Finally GZIP is applied. You really don't want to do this hard work on every request.

- ## Python
  Hyde let's you do massive amount of things without ever knowing what's under the hood. Python let's you dig deeper. You can for example extend the template language with your custom tags, filters and functions.

- ## Image processing
  You can configure hyde to take your images and resize them to a certain size, generate thumbnails or add Exif data.

# For us all

- ## Bloggers
    You want your blog to be blazing fast and you need complete control. Not just for the entries you write but also the layout, looks and logic. Most importantly you want to use your text editor with competent spell checking and syntax highlight.


- ## Freelancers
  Think of using your own templates that you use over and over. And when a client wants something different you inherit from an existing template. No need to repeat yourself. Deliver fast and once the site is in production it's there forever. Always running.


- ## System administrators
  A static site is one big worry less. The business logic is encapsulated into services. Developers are focused tasks that are not dependent on each other. Less confusion and easier to manage. Architecture is more about separate clean API's than interlinked spaghetti.


- ## Quick sites
  Weddings, parties, meetings, presentations, projects .. you just want a site fast. Hyde is perfect for that. You develop templates to your personal use that you can reuse later. Want interaction? Use [Moot](http://moot.it) for discussion or [Wufoo](http://wufoo.com) for forms.


- ## Simple minds
  Tired of the complexity all around you? We are. This is why hyde was born. Our site was crashing; it was complex mixture of different technologies and constantly being attacked agains. We just wanted a site that works and focus on content and services.


- ## Large organizations
  Text files under version management software scale to hundreds of concurrent developers, designers and copywriters. They are designed so. Linux kernel is developed so with over 1000 active contributors. You can have multiple versions and merge others' work in total control.
