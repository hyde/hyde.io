# Nothing beats static content
### Always up, more traffic, longer visits and a good night sleep

<div id="chart">

    <div class="bar">
        <label>Django</label>
        <span style="width:2px"></span>
        <strong>100 requests per second</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="bar">
        <label>Django, cached</label>
        <span style="width:20px"></span>
        <strong>500</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="bar" id="bar_static">
        <label>Static file</label>
        <span style="width:700px"></span>
        <strong>7000</strong>
    </div>

- ## As fast as it gets
    Static pages are served directly without any processing. CPU intensive work such as templating, minification and gzipping are done beforehand.
    Dynamic pages are generated on every page request slowing it down. The fact is that nothing beats static content. Nothing.

- ## Always running
  Static site is always up. It never crashes. Sudden traffic increase is genuinely welcome.
  A heavy burden taken away from every member working on the site. 100% uptime is an unreachable and expensive dream for dynamic websites.

- ## 100% secure
  Dynamic sites are on constant fight against various kinds of attacks. DOS attacks are not rare. You see security updates all over the web.
  Static content will put an end to it. There are no holes.

- ## Cacheable
  A page served from browser's cache loads immediately without network traffic. This essential performance pattern is too often ignored.
  Typically only CSS, images and JavaScript is cached. Now you can do the same for your content.

- ## Previewable
  The generated site is just a directory on the local computer. It's easy to go trough the pages and see the final result before uploading
  the site to the live server. You can be sure that the site works similarly on production. No hidden surprises.

- ## Cheap and portable
  Static pages can be installed on any web server. You are not tied to any programming language or server framework.
  No complex database or library dependencies to keep up to. Just drop a folder. And it's cheap! It does not eat memory or CPU.

# Static content. Dynamic services.
![Static content + dynamic services](http://dribbble.com/system/users/1211/screenshots/79771/shot_1289941112.jpg?1304360443)

-   ## Overall stability

    When dynamics are separated from the site to task-focused services they are not dependent on each other.
    If a service fails the site keeps running. And while you can be sure that static site is always running it will never crash the services.

-   ## Global reach

    When a service is decoupled from the site it becomes a self hosting entity with a clean API.
    The service can be used by multiple sites and different devices. It can be for your own use only or you can build a global service for everyone to enjoy.

-   ## Developer friendly

    Ruby, python, node.js, PHP, Java and combinations - anything can be used to build a service. There's only an interface to be implemented.
    The client does not matter what's behind it. Developers love this.

-   ## Management friendly

    The project can use developers with different backgrounds. Without language restrictions you can pick the best skills around.
    You are forced to design your system well resulting better products in less time to market.

-   ## JavaScript

    The glue between the site and the services is JavaScript which today is enabled in 99.5% of browsers. It's completely safe to use it.
    So does anyone else. You cannot see nothing if JavaScript is disabled in twitter.com and they do pretty well.

# Plain text is forever
![Markdown syntax](http://dribbble.com/system/users/455/screenshots/15159/shot_1271111579.png?1301523495)


- ## Forget web interfaces
    Nothing beats plain text and the editor you love. It's easy to get lost with databases and web based content management.
    This is obvious for hackers but now also for everyone working on the site.

- ## Everything is a text file
  This old UNIX philosophy is essential for a web developer. You need a direct access to content, layout, style and logic.
  No extra markup or hidden surprises. Just plain text and complete control.

- ## Modern editors
  Templates, snippets, keyboard shortcuts, syntax highlight, shell, spell checking &hellip; Textmate, jEdit, eclipse, emacs, VIM &hellip;
  A religious, lifetime relationship. You get better every day.

- ## Versioning and backup
  Life is easier with plain text than with a database. With ersion management you have group editing, update history and backups without you even knowing it.
  Not to mention the great tricks you can do with Git or Mercurial.

- ## Edit and publish
  Edit a file locally and run a single command to publish it. No admin interfaces or weird idioms. Not even a need for internet connection.
